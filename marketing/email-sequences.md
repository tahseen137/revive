## 🔥 HOT LEAD SEQUENCE (5 Emails)
**Target**: People who posted about payment failures THIS WEEK
**Examples**: Alex Berman (Email10.com), u/StripeUserFrustrated, u/IndieSaaSFounder

### Email 1: Personalized Opener (Day 1)
**Subject**: Re: your post about failed payments

Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [specific complaint — e.g., "22% churn from Stripe failures"]. That's brutal.

Here's the kicker: Most SaaS companies only recover 5-10% of those failed payments. But with the right retry timing and dunning flow, you can hit 30-40% recovery.

I built Revive specifically for this. **You only pay when we actually recover revenue** — zero upfront cost.

Want to see how much MRR you're leaving on the table? I'll run a free audit.

### Email 2: The 9% Problem (Day 3)
**Subject**: The hidden cost of failed payments

[Name],

Quick data point: **The average SaaS loses 9% of MRR to involuntary churn.**

That's not customers canceling — it's expired cards, insufficient funds, and auth failures.

Here's what we saw analyzing 127 SaaS companies:
- 68% were recovering <10% of failed payments
- Those using smart retry logic hit 25-35% recovery
- Best performers (with proper dunning) reach 40%+

At [their MRR], you're likely leaving **$[calculated amount]** on the table every month.

**Let me show you the exact recovery potential for your business.** No pitch — just your numbers.

### Email 3: How Revive Works (Day 6)
**Subject**: 3-step payment recovery (visual)

[Name],

Here's exactly how Revive recovers your failed payments:

**Step 1: Smart Retries**
We retry based on decline codes — not random timing.
- Expired cards → dunning immediately (retries won't work)
- Insufficient funds → retry on payday (3-day intervals)
- Card declined → 4-hour intervals (3 attempts max)

**Step 2: Dunning That Works**
One-click card update links in emails. No login required.
→ 68% open rate vs. 12% for "please log in" emails

**Step 3: Multi-Channel Recovery**
Email → SMS → In-app (if needed)
First 72 hours are critical — recovery drops 80% after day 3.

**Result**: 25-40% recovery rate (vs. 5-10% doing it manually)

### Email 4: Performance-Based Pricing (Day 9)
**Subject**: You only pay if we recover your money

[Name],

Most payment recovery tools charge $249-500/month upfront.

**Revive is different: You only pay when we actually recover revenue.**

Here's the model:
- $0 setup fees
- $0 monthly minimum  
- 15% of recovered revenue only

**Example**: If we recover $3,000 in failed payments this month:
- You get: $2,550
- We get: $450
- Your alternative: $0 (that revenue was lost)

**Zero risk.** If we don't recover money, you don't pay.

Most customers see 10x ROI in the first quarter.

At [their MRR], you're likely leaving $[amount]/mo on the table. Want to see your exact numbers?

P.S. — 60-day money-back guarantee if recovery < 15%. We're that confident.

### Email 5: Final Follow-Up (Day 12)
**Subject**: Last thing (+ free churn audit)

Best of luck with [their product]!

## 🌡️ WARM LEAD SEQUENCE (3 Emails)
**Target**: Founders discussing solutions, problem-aware but not urgent
**Examples**: Sarah Chen (TaskFlow), Emma Ruiz (ContentCal.ai), Arvid Kahl

### Email 1: Value-First Opener (Day 1)
**Subject**: Quick win for your payment recovery

Hey [Name],

Saw you're [mention their context — e.g., "using Customer.io for dunning" / "discussing churn on IH"].

Want to share three things that immediately boost recovery rates:

**1. Retry timing by decline code**
Insufficient funds → 3-day intervals (payday-aligned)
Card declined → 4-hour intervals
Expired cards → skip retries, go straight to dunning

**2. One-click card update links**
68% open rate vs. 12% for "log in to update" emails

**3. First 72-hour window**  
Recovery drops 80% after day 3

Those three changes alone can move you from 10% to 25%+ recovery.

We built Revive to automate all of this: **performance-based pricing** (you only pay on recovered revenue).

### Email 2: Case Study (Day 5)
**Subject**: How [Similar Company] recovered 38% of failed payments

[Name],

Quick case study that might be relevant:

**[Similar company/industry]** was at $22k MRR with 18% churn (60% involuntary from payment failures).

Their setup:
- Stripe Smart Retries (basic)
- Manual dunning emails
- Recovery rate: **11%**

After switching to Revive:
- Smart retry logic by decline code
- Automated dunning with 1-click card updates
- Multi-channel recovery (email → SMS → in-app)
- New recovery rate: **38%**

**Result**: $2,500/mo in recovered MRR — $2,125 net after our 15% fee.

Your business looks similar. At [their MRR], you're likely leaving $[amount]/mo on the table.

### Email 3: Risk Reversal (Day 10)
**Subject**: Zero risk, guaranteed results

[Name],

Last follow-up from me.

I get it — you're evaluating options, bandwidth is tight, another tool is the last thing you need.

Here's why Revive is different:

**No upfront cost**  
You only pay 15% of revenue we actually recover. If we recover $0, you pay $0.

**60-day guarantee**  
If recovery rate < 15%, full refund.

**2-hour setup**  
Direct Stripe integration via webhook. We handle it.

**Set-and-forget**  
Automated retries + dunning. You just watch recovered revenue roll in.

Most customers hit positive ROI within 30 days.

If you're losing >$500/mo to failed payments (most SaaS are), this is a no-brainer.

Either way, good luck with [their product]!

## 🚀 PERSONALIZATION TOKENS

Replace these in every email:
- `[Name]` → Prospect first name
- `[Product]` → Their product name
- `[specific complaint]` → Quote from their post/tweet
- `[their MRR]` → If publicly shared
- `[calculated amount]` → MRR × 0.09 × 0.7 (70% of 9% lost MRR)
- `[Similar company/industry]` → Match their vertical

**Example calculation**:
- MRR: $50,000
- Lost to failures: $50k × 0.09 = $4,500
- Recoverable at 40%: $4,500 × 0.40 = $1,800
- Net after 15% fee: $1,800 × 0.85 = $1,530/mo

## 🎤 FOLLOW-UP AFTER REPLY

### If they ask about pricing:
"No upfront cost — you only pay 15% of revenue we recover. Most customers see $[amount]/mo in recovered MRR, which nets $[after fee]. ROI positive within 30 days typically. Want me to run your exact numbers?"

### If they ask about setup:
"2-hour integration. We connect via Stripe webhook, import your decline history, and set up your dunning sequences. Most customers are live same day. I can walk you through it on a quick call if helpful."

### If they say "not now":
"Totally understand. Can I send you our churn audit template? It's a free spreadsheet that helps you calculate exactly how much you're losing to failed payments. No strings attached — just useful data."

### If they're already using a competitor:
"Got it. Just curious — what's your current recovery rate? We're seeing most tools plateau at 20-25%, but with [specific tactic], you can push to 35-40%. Happy to compare notes even if you stick with [competitor]."

---

## ⚠️ DO NOT:
- Send more than 5 emails to hot leads (respect the sequence)
- Use clickbait subject lines ("You won't believe..." "This one trick...")
- Go over 100 words (people skim, brevity wins)
- Pitch multiple things in one email (ONE clear CTA)
- Forget to personalize (generic = ignored)
- Be pushy after "not interested" (graceful exit)

---

## ✨ PRO TIPS:

1. **Send from founder email** (not support@) — gets 2x opens
2. **Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm EST** — best open rates
3. **Plain text > HTML** — feels personal, avoids spam filters
4. **No attachments in first email** — spam trigger
5. **Test everything** — subject lines, CTAs, timing
6. **Track opens/clicks** — double down on what works
7. **Use video in Email 3** — Loom walkthrough of how it works
8. **Reference their product by name** — shows you did research
9. **Mirror their communication style** — casual = casual, formal = formal
10. **Always provide value** — even if they don't buy, teach them something
