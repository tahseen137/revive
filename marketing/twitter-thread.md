**Tweet 1 (Hook)**

3 months ago, I checked my Stripe dashboard and realized I was losing $847/month to failed payments.

Not cancellations. Just expired cards and random bank declines.

I built a tool to get it back. Now it's a $5.8K MRR SaaS.

Here's the full story 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**

The worst part? I had NO IDEA it was happening.

Stripe retries failed payments once or twice, then gives up. Customers don't get notified properly. Revenue just... disappears.

I was losing 9% of my MRR to involuntary churn.

That's $10K+ per year. Gone.

---

**Tweet 3 (The "Aha" Moment)**

I asked founder friends if they had the same problem.

Every. Single. One.

"Yeah, I have $2K sitting in failed payments."
"I built a janky Zapier thing that breaks constantly."
"Baremetrics charges 25% of recovered revenue, so I just... don't use it."

This was a REAL problem.

**Tweet 4 (The Build)**

Spent 6 weeks building Revive:

✅ Smart retry logic (retries at optimal times based on failure type)
✅ Automated dunning emails (personalized, not robotic)
✅ One-click Stripe OAuth (3-minute setup)

Launched MVP. Put myself on it first.

First week: recovered $340 I would've lost.

**Tweet 5 (Early Traction)**

Posted about it on Twitter. 12 DMs in the first hour.

Month 1: $1,200 MRR (47 customers)
Month 2: $3,600 MRR (word-of-mouth kicks in)
Month 3: $5,800 MRR (200 customers)

Total revenue recovered for customers: $2.4M+

Average recovery rate: 94%

This is wild.

**Tweet 6 (Why It's Different)**

"Why not just use Baremetrics/Churnkey?"

**Baremetrics Recover**: $50/mo + 25% of what you recover. If you recover $5K, they take $1,250. Every month.

**Churnkey**: Enterprise tool. Takes 2+ hours to set up.

**Revive**: $29/mo flat. 3-minute setup. No revenue sharing.

Simple wins.

## Alternative Hooks (A/B Test These)

**Option A (Fear-based):**
You're probably losing $500-$2K/month right now and don't even know it.

Here's how I discovered I was hemorrhaging money — and built a $5.8K MRR SaaS to fix it 🧵

**Option B (Curiosity-based):**
I built a SaaS tool in 6 weeks that's already recovered $2.4M for 200+ companies.

It solves a problem most founders don't even know they have.

Here's the story 🧵

**Option C (Social proof):**
200 SaaS founders are using my tool to recover failed payments.

$2.4M+ recovered in 3 months.

I built it because I was tired of losing 9% of my MRR to involuntary churn.

Full breakdown 🧵

## Thread Best Practices

- **Hook in first 100 characters** (mobile preview matters)
- **1 idea per tweet** (easy to read, easy to retweet individual tweets)
- **Numbers > adjectives** ("94% recovery rate" > "really good recovery")
- **End with clear CTA** (link + action verb)
- **Optional engagement tweet** at the end (builds followers, starts convos)

## Posting Strategy

1. **Post at 9-11 AM EST** (highest engagement for B2B SaaS audience)
2. **Pin the thread** to profile for 48 hours
3. **Retweet yourself** 6-8 hours later (different timezone audience)
4. **Reply to comments quickly** (first 2 hours matter most for engagement)
5. **Quote-tweet with results** after 24 hours ("This thread got 50 signups. Here's what I learned...")
