# Cold DM Templates for SaaS Founders

## Instructions
- **Personalize the [brackets]** — mention their product, a recent tweet, or something specific
- **Keep it under 280 characters** for DM preview (hook matters most)
- **Lead with value, not pitch** — focus on their problem, not your product
- **No generic spam** — if you can't personalize it, don't send it

---

## Template 1: The "I Noticed" Approach
**Use when:** They recently tweeted about MRR, revenue, growth metrics

---

**Subject/Hook:**
Quick Q about [their SaaS name] — curious how you handle failed payments

**Body:**

Hey [Name], saw your post about hitting [X MRR/milestone] — congrats!

Quick question: have you checked how much you're losing to failed payments lately? 

Most SaaS founders I talk to don't realize they're losing 5-10% of MRR to expired cards and random bank declines.

I built a tool (Revive) that auto-recovers them — 94% success rate, 3-min setup, $29/mo flat (no revenue sharing like Baremetrics).

Worth a 5-min look? Free trial, no CC needed.

## Template 2: The "Problem-First" Approach
**Use when:** You don't know much about them, but they clearly run a Stripe-based SaaS

---

**Subject/Hook:**
You might be losing $[estimate based on MRR] to failed payments right now

**Body:**

[Name], quick heads-up:

If you're on Stripe, there's a good chance you have failed charges sitting in your dashboard right now — customers whose cards failed and Stripe gave up after 1-2 retries.

Average SaaS loses 9% of MRR this way. If you're doing [their MRR estimate], that's ~$[X]/month just... gone.

I built Revive to fix this (already recovered $2.4M+ for 200 companies). Smart retries + dunning emails. 3-min setup.

14-day trial, free: [link]

Even if you don't use it, worth checking your "failed payments" tab in Stripe. You might be surprised.

## Template 3: The "Social Proof" Approach
**Use when:** They're in a similar niche/industry to existing customers

---

**Subject/Hook:**
[Mutual connection/similar SaaS] just recovered $X with this tool

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

[Mutual founder name] told me about [their SaaS] — sounds like you're in a similar space to a few of our customers.

They've been using Revive to recover failed payments (expired cards, bank declines, etc). [Specific customer] recovered $[X] in their first month.

It's basically autopilot for involuntary churn — retries failed charges at optimal times, sends dunning emails, works 24/7.

Since you're on Stripe, figured it might help. 3-min setup, 14-day trial: [link]

Let me know if you want an intro to [mutual founder] — they can share actual results.

---

## Template 4: The "ROI Calculator" Approach
**Use when:** They're analytical/data-driven (engineers, technical founders)

---

**Subject/Hook:**
Math Q: What's 9% of [their MRR]?

**Body:**

[Name], genuine question:

What's 9% of your MRR?

That's the average amount SaaS companies lose to failed payments (Stripe's data, not mine). 

If you're at [estimated MRR], you're probably losing ~$[X]/month to expired cards, wrong addresses, random bank declines.

Revive recovers them automatically — 94% success rate, $29/mo flat fee.

Quick math:
- You recover $[X]/mo → ROI = [X]x
- Setup time: 3 minutes
- Risk: $0 (free trial, no CC required)

Try it: [link]

If it doesn't recover anything, you don't pay. Simple.

---

## Template 5: The "Founder-to-Founder" Approach
**Use when:** You have something in common (same city, similar journey, mutual follows)

---

**Subject/Hook:**
Fellow [bootstrapper/indie hacker/SaaS founder] here — built something you might find useful

**Body:**

[Name], love what you're building with [their product].

I'm a founder too (Revive — failed payment recovery for SaaS). Built it because I was losing $800/month to expired cards and Stripe's default retries weren't cutting it.

Long story short: recovered $2.4M+ for 200 companies so far. 94% success rate, 3-min setup, way cheaper than Baremetrics.

If you're on Stripe, might be worth a look. Free trial: [link]

Either way, happy to chat about SaaS stuff if you ever want to jam. Always down to swap notes with other founders 🤙

---

## Bonus: The "Post-Engagement" Follow-Up
**Use when:** They liked/commented on one of your tweets about Revive

---

**Subject/Hook:**
Thanks for the like on my Revive thread — quick Q

**Body:**

Hey [Name], saw you liked my thread about failed payment recovery.

Curious — is this a problem you've dealt with? Or just found it interesting?

Happy to give you early access / answer any Qs if you want to try it out.

Either way, appreciate the support 🙏

## DM Strategy & Best Practices

### When to Send
- **Best times**: Tues-Thurs, 9-11 AM or 2-4 PM (their timezone)
- **Avoid**: Mondays (inbox overload), Fridays (checked out), weekends (invasive)

### Personalization Checklist
Before sending, can you answer YES to these?
- [ ] Used their actual name (not "Hey there")
- [ ] Mentioned their product/company specifically
- [ ] Referenced something recent (tweet, milestone, post)
- [ ] Estimated their MRR/problem size accurately
- [ ] Explained why THIS tool for THEM (not generic pitch)

### Response Rates (Expected)
- **Cold DMs (no prior interaction)**: 5-15% response rate
- **Warm DMs (they engaged with your content)**: 30-50% response rate
- **Referral DMs (mutual connection mentioned)**: 60%+ response rate

### Follow-Up Cadence
- **Day 1**: Send initial DM
- **Day 4**: Soft follow-up if no response ("Hey [Name], just bumping this in case it got buried. No pressure either way!")
- **Day 8**: Final follow-up with value-add ("Saw you posted about [X] — thought this article might help: [link]. Also, still happy to set up that free trial if you're curious about Revive.")
- **After Day 8**: Stop. Don't be annoying.

### Red Flags (Don't Send If...)
- They have "No DMs" in bio
- They explicitly say "Don't pitch me"
- They're in a completely unrelated industry (B2C, e-commerce, non-SaaS)
- You can't find ANY way to personalize it
- Your estimate of their MRR is a total guess (makes you look dumb if wrong)

### Conversion Tips
1. **Lead with empathy, not pitch** ("Have you dealt with this?" > "Buy my thing")
2. **Make the ROI obvious** (numbers beat adjectives)
3. **Reduce friction** (free trial, no CC, 3-min setup)
4. **Offer a graceful exit** ("Even if you don't use it, worth checking your Stripe dashboard")
5. **Sound like a human** (use contractions, casual language, emojis sparingly)

### What to Track
- **Sent**: How many DMs per day (don't spam — 10-15 max)
- **Opened**: Did they read it? (Twitter shows this)
- **Replied**: What % respond?
- **Booked**: What % want a demo/trial?
- **Converted**: What % become customers?

Aim for:
- 10% reply rate (cold)
- 50% trial signup (of replies)
- 30% conversion (of trials)

If you're below these, tweak your copy or targeting.

**Golden Rule**: If you wouldn't want to receive this DM, don't send it.
