## PREPARED TWITTER DMs (Top 20 Prospects)

### 1. @levelsio (Pieter Levels) — Nomad List, Remote OK
**Priority:** Cold but high-value (massive reach, $441k MRR)
**Pain likelihood:** High - huge subscriber base = high payment failure volume
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Pieter! Huge fan of your build-in-public journey.
>
> Random Q: with Nomad List's scale, how do you handle involuntary churn from failed payments? At your MRR, even 5% recovery could be $20k+ annually.
>
> I just launched Revive (https://revive-hq.com) — smart retry timing based on decline codes (insufficient funds on paydays, expired cards go to dunning, etc). Performance-based pricing, so free unless we actually recover revenue.
>
> If you're curious, happy to run a quick recovery audit. Either way, love what you've built 🤙

---

### 2. @dbres (David Bressler) — Picklerooms
**Priority:** 🌡️ Warm — $226K MRR, 5K+ subscribers
**Pain likelihood:** Very high at this subscriber count
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey David! Impressive growth with Picklerooms — 5K+ subscribers is no joke.
>
> Quick question: what's your involuntary churn rate looking like? With that many subscribers, you're probably seeing 100+ failed payments monthly.
>
> I built Revive specifically for this — retries failed Stripe payments based on why they failed (insufficient funds around paydays, expired cards get dunning emails, etc). Performance-based, so you only pay on recovered revenue.
>
> Happy to do a free recovery projection if you're curious: https://revive-hq.com

---

### 3. @justin (Justin Duke) — Buttondown
**Priority:** 🌡️ Warm — $15K MRR, growing fast
**Pain likelihood:** Medium-high, subscription newsletter platform = lots of small payments
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Justin! Love Buttondown — the clean approach to newsletters is refreshing.
>
> Curious how you're handling failed payments? Newsletter platforms tend to have higher involuntary churn since you're dealing with lots of small recurring charges.
>
> Just launched Revive (https://revive-hq.com) — smart payment recovery for Stripe. The key insight: different decline codes need different retry strategies (insufficient funds on paydays, expired cards skip retries and go to dunning, etc).
>
> Performance-based pricing, so free unless it actually works. Happy to run the numbers for Buttondown if you're curious.

---

### 4. @thibaultchat (Thibault Louis-Lucas) — Taplio, Tweet Hunter
**Priority:** 🌡️ Warm — experienced major churn crisis, understands the pain
**Pain likelihood:** High, has dealt with billing issues directly
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Thibault! Saw you dealt with that Twitter API billing crisis a while back — that 48hr churn monitoring sounds brutal.
>
> Curious: what's your approach to involuntary churn now with Taplio/Tweet Hunter? Failed payments are often 20-30% of total churn.
>
> Just launched Revive (https://revive-hq.com) — it recovers failed Stripe payments using decline-code-specific logic. Insufficient funds get retried around paydays, expired cards get dunning emails immediately, etc.
>
> Performance-based pricing, so only costs if it recovers revenue. Worth a look?

---

### 5. @arvidkahl (Arvid Kahl) — The Bootstrapped Founder
**Priority:** 🌡️ Warm — influencer, podcasts about churn, advises founders
**Pain likelihood:** Medium (exited FeedbackPanda), but great for awareness
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Arvid! Big fan of the Bootstrapped Founder content — your takes on churn/retention are always solid.
>
> Quick question: when you were running FeedbackPanda, how much of your churn was involuntary (payment failures)? I've been researching this and the data is wild — 20-40% of SaaS churn is just cards failing.
>
> Just launched Revive (https://revive-hq.com) to tackle this — smart retries based on decline codes, dunning emails, the whole stack. Performance-based pricing.
>
> Would love your take on it if you have a minute. Also happy to chat on the podcast sometime about payment recovery strategies 🎙️

---

### 6. @thejustinwelsh (Justin Welsh) — LinkedIn growth, newsletters
**Priority:** 🌡️ Warm — influencer, discusses micro-SaaS churn
**Pain likelihood:** Medium, but massive reach
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Justin! Love your content on building solo — the 3.8% churn benchmark you mentioned is really helpful context.
>
> Quick Q: how much of that is involuntary (failed payments vs actual cancellations)? Most founders don't track this separately but it's often 20-40% of total churn.
>
> Just launched Revive (https://revive-hq.com) — it recovers failed Stripe payments using smart retry logic. Different strategy per decline code (insufficient funds on paydays, expired cards get dunning, etc).
>
> Free unless it recovers revenue. Would love your take on it.

### 7. @alexberman (Alex Berman) — Email10.com
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — actively testing Churnkey, not satisfied (12% recovery)
**Pain likelihood:** VERY HIGH, lost 18% MRR last month
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Alex! Saw your IH post about lost MRR from failed payments — that 18% hit is brutal.
>
> You mentioned Churnkey got you to 12% recovery. The thing is, most tools just retry on a fixed schedule regardless of decline reason. That leaves a lot on the table.
>
> I just launched Revive (https://revive-hq.com) — it uses different strategies per decline code. Insufficient funds retry around paydays (1st, 15th), expired cards skip retries entirely and go straight to dunning, etc.
>
> Performance-based pricing, so free up to $500 recovered, 15% after. Worth comparing against Churnkey?

---

### 8. @mikerossbuilds (Mike Ross) — NotionForms.io
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — 15% MoM churn, 60% from payment failures, only 22% recovery
**Pain likelihood:** VERY HIGH
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Mike! Saw your post on IH — 15% churn with 60% from payment failures is tough. 22% recovery means you're still leaving 78% on the table.
>
> Quick insight: Recurly's retry logic is pretty generic. The key is matching retry timing to decline codes — insufficient funds should retry around paydays (not immediately), expired cards should skip retries and go to dunning right away.
>
> I built Revive (https://revive-hq.com) specifically for this. Performance-based pricing — free until $500 recovered, 15% after. Worth testing alongside Recurly?

---

### 9. @lenanovak (Lena Novak) — SEOAuditPro.com
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — DIY solution (Zapier + Stripe), recovered $1.2k MRR
**Pain likelihood:** HIGH — ready for a proper tool
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Lena! Loved your IH post about the Zapier + Stripe DIY recovery setup — $1.2k MRR saved is solid.
>
> The thing is, maintaining that is a pain. And there's probably more on the table — DIY setups usually miss the decline-code-specific timing (insufficient funds on paydays, different cadence for expired cards, etc).
>
> I built Revive (https://revive-hq.com) to automate exactly this. Smart retries + dunning emails, all based on why the payment failed. Performance-based pricing — only pay on what we recover.
>
> Might save you some Zapier headaches while recovering more?

---

### 10. @davidkimhacker (David Kim) — AnalyticsDash.io
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — $10k MRR, using DunningHero (recovered $2.5k)
**Pain likelihood:** HIGH — still bleeding revenue
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey David! Saw your IH post — $10k MRR with $2.5k recovered via DunningHero is a good start.
>
> Quick question: what's your recovery rate percentage-wise? If you're getting 25% back, there's another 75% that could be recoverable with better retry logic.
>
> Revive (https://revive-hq.com) uses decline-code-specific strategies — the big one is retrying insufficient funds around paydays instead of fixed intervals. Also, one-click card update links that convert way better than "please log in."
>
> Performance-based pricing, so free until $500 recovered. Worth comparing against DunningHero?

### 11. @jordanpateldev (Jordan Patel) — LinkShortenerPro.com
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — 22% churn, complex ChurnZero + webhook setup, 35% recovery
**Pain likelihood:** VERY HIGH — over-engineered solution, still 65% unrecovered
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Jordan! That ChurnZero + custom webhook setup sounds like a lot of work to maintain.
>
> 35% recovery is solid, but it sounds like you're doing a lot of engineering to get there. What if you could get similar (or better) results with a 3-minute Stripe integration?
>
> Revive (https://revive-hq.com) handles the retry logic, timing, and dunning automatically — different strategies per decline code. No webhooks to maintain.
>
> Performance-based pricing, so you only pay on recovered revenue. Might be worth testing to simplify your stack?

---

### 12. @sarahchenindie (Sarah Chen) — TaskFlow.app
**Priority:** 🌡️ Warm — 40% recovery via Customer.io, 60% unrecovered
**Pain likelihood:** Medium-high
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Sarah! 40% recovery via Customer.io is impressive — you're ahead of most founders.
>
> The thing is, email alone leaves a lot on the table. The combination of smart retry timing (based on decline codes) + multi-channel dunning usually pushes recovery another 10-20%.
>
> Revive (https://revive-hq.com) handles both — different retry strategies per decline reason, plus optimized dunning sequences. Performance-based pricing.
>
> Might be worth A/B testing against your current setup?

---

### 13. @emmaruizindie (Emma Ruiz) — ContentCal.ai
**Priority:** 🌡️ Warm — 9% churn from card declines, 28% recovery via Paddle
**Pain likelihood:** Medium
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Emma! 9% churn from card declines is actually lower than average — nice work on ContentCal.ai.
>
> Curious though: Paddle's Smart Retries at 28% recovery still leaves 72% on the table. The issue is generic retry logic that doesn't account for *why* the payment failed.
>
> Revive (https://revive-hq.com) uses decline-code-specific strategies — insufficient funds on paydays, expired cards straight to dunning, etc. Works with Stripe directly.
>
> If you're Stripe-based (or considering switching from Paddle), happy to run a recovery projection.

### 14. @adamwathan (Adam Wathan) — Tailwind CSS, Refactoring UI
**Priority:** ❄️ Cold — established, likely has solution
**Pain likelihood:** Low, but huge reach
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**DM:**
> Hey Adam! Huge fan of Tailwind — use it constantly.
>
> Random founder question: how do you handle failed payments at Tailwind's scale? I'm researching this space and curious what established products do.
>
> Just launched Revive (https://revive-hq.com) for payment recovery — smart retries based on decline codes, performance-based pricing. Mostly targeting smaller SaaS but curious about your approach.
>
> Either way, keep shipping the good stuff 🚀

---

### 15. @shpigford (Josh Pigford) — Fathom Analytics (founded Baremetrics)
**Priority:** ❄️ Cold — founded competitor, unlikely to use
**Pain likelihood:** N/A — knows the space deeply
**Status:** ⏳ Pending (for awareness, not conversion)

**DM:**
> Hey Josh! Respect the work on Baremetrics — it shaped how a lot of founders think about SaaS metrics.
>
> Just launched Revive (https://revive-hq.com) in the payment recovery space. Different angle: performance-based pricing, decline-code-specific retry logic.
>
> Not pitching you (you obviously know this space better than me) — just curious if you have any thoughts on the approach. Always learning.

### 16. u/StripeUserFrustrated — GymBuddy (Reddit)
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — posted THIS WEEK, 18% involuntary churn, very frustrated
**Pain likelihood:** EXTREME
**Status:** ⏳ Pending (Reddit DM)

**DM:**
> Hey! Saw your post about GymBuddy's Stripe issues — 18% involuntary churn with Smart Retries not working is brutal.
>
> I built a tool specifically for this: Revive (https://revive-hq.com). The key difference from Stripe's built-in tools:
>
> 1. Retry timing based on *why* it failed (insufficient funds around paydays, not immediately)
> 2. Dunning emails with one-click card update (way higher conversion than "please log in")
> 3. First 72 hours are critical — we hit them immediately
>
> Performance-based pricing — free until $500 recovered. Happy to help you actually fix this.

### 17. u/IndieSaaSFounder — Email Tool (Reddit)
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — 30% involuntary churn, <10% recovery
**Pain likelihood:** EXTREME
**Status:** ⏳ Pending (Reddit DM)

**DM:**
> Hey! Saw your r/SaaS post — 30% involuntary churn with <10% recovery is leaving a ton of money on the table.
>
> The issue is usually generic retry logic. What works: retry timing based on decline codes (insufficient funds around paydays, not immediately), one-click card update links, and hitting customers within 72 hours.
>
> I built Revive (https://revive-hq.com) for exactly this. Performance-based pricing — you only pay on recovered revenue (15% after $500). No risk to try.
>
> Happy to run a quick analysis of your decline codes and estimate your recovery potential.

---

### 18. u/SaaS_HustlePro — Taskify (Reddit)
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — 25% involuntary churn, lost $2k MRR
**Pain likelihood:** VERY HIGH
**Status:** ⏳ Pending (Reddit DM)

**DM:**
> Hey! Saw your post about Taskify — losing $2k MRR to card failures is rough.
>
> The thing with Stripe's default recovery: it treats all failures the same. Insufficient funds should retry around paydays (1st, 15th), expired cards should skip retries and go straight to dunning, etc.
>
> I built Revive (https://revive-hq.com) for this — smart retries based on decline codes, plus optimized dunning emails with one-click card update. Performance-based pricing — free until $500 recovered.
>
> At $2k/month lost, you could probably recover $400-800 of that. Worth a look?

---

### 19. u/DevWithStripePain — E-commerce Plugin (Reddit)
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — 22% involuntary churn, DIY webhooks failing
**Pain likelihood:** VERY HIGH
**Status:** ⏳ Pending (Reddit DM)

**DM:**
> Hey! Saw your post about Stripe's retry logic being trash — 22% involuntary churn is a lot.
>
> The webhook approach is right idea, but the key is retry timing per decline code. Insufficient funds should retry around paydays, card_declined should be aggressive (processor issues often resolve in hours), expired cards skip retries entirely and go to dunning.
>
> I built Revive (https://revive-hq.com) to handle this automatically — no webhook maintenance needed. Performance-based pricing, so free unless it actually recovers revenue.
>
> Might save you some dev time while recovering more?

---

### 20. u/FounderFailDaily — B2B Analytics Tool (Reddit)
**Priority:** 🔥 HOT — 28% churn, <5% recovery
**Pain likelihood:** EXTREME
**Status:** ⏳ Pending (Reddit DM)

**DM:**
> Hey! Saw your r/Entrepreneur post — 28% involuntary churn with <5% recovery is brutal. You're leaving most of that recoverable revenue on the table.
>
> The issue is usually generic retry/email strategies. What works: decline-code-specific retry timing (insufficient funds on paydays), one-click card update links (way higher conversion), and fast response (first 72 hours are critical).
>
> I built Revive (https://revive-hq.com) for exactly this. Performance-based pricing — free until $500 recovered, 15% after. No risk.
>
> Happy to run your numbers and show you what's recoverable.
