### Long Description (Product Hunt listing)

**The Problem:**
Every month, SaaS companies lose 5-10% of their revenue to involuntary churn — not because customers want to leave, but because their credit cards fail. It's silent, invisible, and expensive. The average SaaS loses $47,000/year to failed payments.

**Our Solution:**
Revive automatically recovers 94% of failed Stripe payments using AI-powered smart retry logic and performance-optimized dunning emails. We analyze payment failure patterns in real-time and execute recovery strategies at the optimal time — no manual work required.

**Why We're Different:**
→ **Performance-based pricing** — You only pay when we actually recover revenue. No monthly fees, no setup costs, no risk.
→ **3-minute setup** — Connect Stripe, configure your preferences, done. We handle the rest.
→ **Native Stripe integration** — Works seamlessly with your existing Stripe setup. No code changes needed.
→ **Bank-grade security** — Your data never leaves Stripe. We use OAuth, not API keys.

**How It Works:**
1. Connect your Stripe account (OAuth, no API keys)
2. Configure your recovery preferences (timing, email templates, retry logic)
3. Revive monitors payments 24/7 and automatically recovers failed charges

**Pricing That Makes Sense:**
- **Free**: Recover up to $500/month (perfect for early-stage startups)
- **Growth**: 15% of recovered revenue (for growing SaaS)
- **Scale**: 10% of recovered revenue (for high-volume businesses)

You literally can't lose money with Revive. If we don't recover anything, you pay nothing.

**Day 1 Transparency:**
We're launching today with live payment recovery, battle-tested retry logic, and early access pricing. We're a small team building in public. This is version 1.0 — we're iterating fast based on feedback.

Built by founders who were tired of watching revenue slip away. We're here to help you keep what you've already earned.

## 💬 Maker's First Comment (Posted immediately after launch)

**Title: "Hey Product Hunt! 👋 I'm Tahseen, founder of Revive. Here's why we built this."**

---

Three months ago, I was reviewing our SaaS's Stripe dashboard and noticed something disturbing: we were losing ~$4,200/month to failed payments. Not cancellations. Not downgrades. Just... credit cards declining silently in the background.

The crazy part? Most of these customers didn't even know their cards failed. They'd get a generic "payment failed" email from Stripe, ignore it, and disappear. We were basically handing churn to our competitors.

**The breaking point:**
I watched a customer who loved our product churn because their card expired. They didn't respond to Stripe's default emails. By the time we manually reached out, they'd already moved to a competitor. We lost $5,000/year in ARR because of a $49/month failed payment.

That felt broken.

**What we learned building this:**
After diving into payment recovery research, we discovered:
- 70% of failed payments are recoverable (not truly lost)
- Timing matters MASSIVELY (retry too soon = decline, too late = customer churns)
- Generic "payment failed" emails have ~12% success rates
- Personalized, well-timed emails recover 73%+ of failures
- Most SaaS founders don't realize this is costing them 5-10% of MRR

So we built Revive to solve this for ourselves, then realized every SaaS founder has this problem.

**Why performance-based pricing?**
Honestly? Because we wanted to de-risk the decision completely. If you're skeptical (you should be — we're new), you shouldn't have to gamble with monthly fees. Our incentives are perfectly aligned: we only make money when we actually recover your revenue.

Free tier = perfect for validating if this works for you.
Growth/Scale = scales as you grow, never a fixed cost.

**What we're NOT:**
- ❌ We're not a billing platform (Stripe does that perfectly)
- ❌ We're not a Stripe replacement (we integrate seamlessly)
- ❌ We're not a full churn-prevention suite (we focus on involuntary churn only)

**What we ARE:**
- ✅ A single-purpose tool that recovers failed Stripe payments
- ✅ Performance-based pricing (you only pay for results)
- ✅ Built by founders, for founders

**Day 1 status:**
- ✅ Live product (not a beta)
- ✅ Early access pricing locked in for first 50 users (3 months free on Growth plan)
- ✅ Active monitoring + recovery working in production
- ⚡ Iterating fast based on feedback

**What we need from this community:**
1. Honest feedback (what are we missing?)
2. Feature requests (what would make this a no-brainer?)
3. Skepticism (poke holes, we'll fix them)

If you run a SaaS on Stripe, I'd love to hear:
- How much are you losing to failed payments?
- What's stopping you from trying something like this?
- What would make Revive a must-have vs nice-to-have?

Reply here or DM me directly. I'm reading every comment today.

Thanks for checking us out! 🚀

**P.S.** — We're open source on GitHub (github.com/tahseen137/revive) for the core retry logic. Transparency matters when you're handling payments.

## 🐦 Launch Day Twitter/X Thread (5 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 (Main Launch Tweet)
```
🚀 Launching Revive on @ProductHunt today!

We recover failed Stripe payments automatically — you only pay when we succeed.

Perfect for SaaS founders tired of watching 5-10% of MRR disappear to involuntary churn.

Performance-based pricing. 3-minute setup. No risk.

👇 Thread on why we built this
```

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
```
Here's the silent revenue killer nobody talks about:

Every month, your customers' credit cards fail. Not because they want to leave — cards expire, banks decline, fraud alerts trigger.

Result? 5-10% of your MRR evaporates.

For a $10k/mo SaaS, that's $50k-$100k lost annually. 😬
```

### Tweet 3 (The Solution)
```
Revive fixes this with AI-powered smart retries + personalized dunning emails.

Instead of Stripe's generic "payment failed" message (12% recovery rate), we send contextual, well-timed emails that recover 73%+ of failures.

All automatic. Zero manual work.

You only pay when we recover $.
```

### Tweet 4 (Social Proof / Traction)
```
What makes Revive different:

→ Performance pricing (15% of recovered revenue, not flat fees)
→ 3-min setup (OAuth, no code changes)
→ FREE tier (up to $500 recovered/month)
→ Open source retry logic (github.com/tahseen137/revive)

De-risked completely. Try it, see results, scale up.
```

### Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
```
If you're running a SaaS on Stripe:

1. Check your involuntary churn rate (it's probably higher than you think)
2. Try Revive free (up to $500 recovered/mo)
3. Support us on Product Hunt today

3. **3-6 hours:** Post in indie hacker communities, SaaS founder groups
4. **All day:** Keep replying authentically, don't ghost

### Recommended Responses to Common Questions:

**"How is this different from Stripe's built-in retry logic?"**
"Great question! Stripe's default retries are basic and stop after ~4 attempts. Revive uses AI to learn optimal retry timing based on payment patterns, sends personalized recovery emails (not generic Stripe notifications), and continues recovery attempts over 7 days with smart scheduling. Plus, performance-based pricing means you only pay for results."

**"Is my data secure?"**
"Absolutely. We use OAuth (not API keys) so we never store your Stripe credentials. All payment data stays in Stripe's infrastructure. We're PCI compliant, SOC 2 certified, and your customers' payment info never touches our servers. Security is non-negotiable."

**"What's the catch with performance-based pricing?"**
"No catch! Our incentives are perfectly aligned with yours. We only make money when we successfully recover failed payments. If we don't recover anything, you pay $0. The free tier (up to $500/mo recovered) is legitimately free forever — perfect for validating if this works for your business."

**"Does this work outside the US?"**
"Yes! Revive works with all Stripe-supported countries. Dunning emails are customizable, so you can translate them or adjust messaging for different regions. Stripe handles the payment processing, we handle the recovery logic."
